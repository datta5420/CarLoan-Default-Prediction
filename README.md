# üöó Car Loan Default Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a client will default on their vehicle loan using machine learning models. The solution was developed for a Hackathon hosted by a non-banking financial institution (NBFI), where minimizing the number of incorrect default predictions is crucial for business profitability.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

An NBFI is facing significant challenges due to rising defaults in the vehicle loan segment. The goal is to build a classification model that accurately predicts the likelihood of default for each client based on their demographic, financial, and transactional features.

---

## üéØ Objective

- Predict whether a customer will **default** on a vehicle loan (0 = No Default, 1 = Default).
- Evaluate models based on the **F1 Score**, a metric that balances **precision** and **recall**.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Overview

There are two datasets provided:

- `Train_Dataset.csv`: Used to train the predictive model.
- `Test_Dataset.csv`: Used for making final predictions to be submitted.

### üëá Submission Format

Your final prediction file should:

- Be a CSV file
- Contain **80900 entries + header row**
- Include two columns:
  - `ID`
  - `Default` (0 or 1)

> ‚úÖ Example:
> ```
> ID,Default  
> 12345,1  
> 67890,0  
> ```
